        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 9, 2025</p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>dev_zone</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses
            information from users ("you" or "your") of our mobile games, including but not limited to <em>Num Slide: Puzzle</em> and
            <em> HidingBlock 3D – Relaxing Game</em>.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>
            We collect certain information when you interact with our games. This includes both personally identifiable information (PII)
            and non-personal information. The data is used to operate, improve, and personalize the user experience, including delivering ads
            and analyzing performance.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Information Collected</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII):</strong> When you interact with ads in our apps, third-party ad networks and
                advertisers may collect information such as your device’s advertising identifier (e.g., IDFA for iOS, AAID for Android) and
                your IP address. This helps with ad targeting and measurement. Please review the privacy policies of those third-party providers
                for full details on how they use your data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong> We may also collect non-personal data, such as device model, operating system version,
                gameplay activity (e.g., level progress, high scores), and ad engagement metrics (e.g., ad clicks, impressions). This data helps us
                improve gameplay experience and optimize ads.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Our games may integrate with third-party services such as advertising networks, analytics providers, and in-app purchase platforms.
            These services operate under their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We do not control their data practices.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We are committed to protecting your data. We apply appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,
            alteration, or loss of your information.
        </p>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our games are not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users under 13.
            If we become aware that such information has been collected, we will take steps to delete it promptly. Please contact us if you
            believe this has occurred.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will take effect immediately upon posting in the app and on our
            website. Continued use of our games after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
